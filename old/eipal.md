Types of Inheritance
Single
Multilevel ( a parent of b, b parent of c)
Hierarchial ( a parent of b,c)

Why Multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java
Multiple inheritance ( a,b parent of c)
If a,b having same method name with arguments c will get confusion which one to use.

Functional Interface
A functional interface has only one abstract method but it can have multiple default methods.
@FunctionalInterface annotation is used to ensure an interface can’t have more than one abstract method. The use of this annotation is optional.

Default and Static Method
Difference between static and default method of interface is default method supports inheritance but static method does not. Default method can be overridden in inheriting interface.

Static and Dynamic Polymorphism
Overloading and over riding

Static keyword
Used in block,method, variable, nested class
When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object.
exactly a single copy of that field is created and shared among all instances of that class.

Volatile
value stored in primary memory instead of cached value in thread. So access when thread is in sleep

Transient
Avoids variable from serialization

Predicate
Predicate is a functional interface, which accepts an argument and returns a boolean. Using it we can create custome validation and we can apply it to filter.

Round
final,Finally,finalize
Java class path

transient and volatile
vector
threads
static
