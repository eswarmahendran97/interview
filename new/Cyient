1) @EnableAutoConfiguration
It scans the classpath for common libraries 
(e.g., spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa) 
And automatically configures the necessary beans and components, such as DispatcherServlet for web applications or DataSource and EntityManager for database interactions.

2) FlatMap in java
flatMap() concatenates all these individual streams into a single, flat stream
list.stream().flatMap(list -> list.stream()).collect(Collectors.toList());

3) Actuators
Provides features for monitoring and managing a Spring Boot application. Eg; health
How to secure it?
Ratelimiter, expose only to tools used, access of authorize person in spring security

4) Java 17
Sealed class
eg: public sealed class Vehicle permits Car, Truck {}
Pattern matching in switch
static String formatter(Object o) {
    return switch (o) {
        case Integer i -> "int: " + i;
        case String s -> "String: " + s;
        default -> "unknown";
    };
}

used instead of enums

5)
public static void main(String[] args) {
	    HashSet shortSet = new HashSet();
	    for(short i=0; i<100; i++){
	        shortSet.add(i);
	        shortSet.remove(i+1);
	    }
		System.out.println(shortSet.size());
}

will not throw expception
no error/exception will be thrown if an element or key is not found when removing from a Set or a Map in Java.

output: 100... trying to remove int when set has short values.. i is short but i+1 becomes int

6) Design pattern in java
Singleton
Adaptor
Saga
Circuitbreaker
Service discovery
Event driven
BFF

6) get second max salary from employe table
SELECT max(salary) from Employee where salary < (SELECT max(salary) from Employee);
Top3
SELECT salary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3;
