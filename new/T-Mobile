Image/Icons will not be in Bundle crerated?
The JavaScript bundle doesn’t embed the actual image pixels, It only includes a URL reference to that optimized image file.
So when your React code runs in the browser:
    <img src="/assets/logo.89df3.png" />
The browser makes a new HTTP request to fetch logo.89df3.png.

Find why web app is slow

Frontend:
Many images or icons - makes many request to get the image or icons
    solution: Single request
        Icon sprite -  A Sprite sheet - single sprite file containing all icons.)
        Image Atlas - Combine all images into one large image
        both are applied with css
